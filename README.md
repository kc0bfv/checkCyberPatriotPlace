This little script checks your cyber patriot team's ranking based on the current scoreboard.  It relies on wget, bash, sed, awk, and normal utils like xargs, wc, cut and grep.  Most of that you probably already have installed.

Edit check.sh - put in your team number on the TEAM line.  Put in the abbreviation cyber patriot uses for your team's state on the STATE line.  If the scoreboard url changes, change SCOREBOARDURL.

Run ./check.sh


That's it!  Good luck.
